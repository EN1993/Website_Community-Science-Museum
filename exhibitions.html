            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky 
            Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about 
            the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and 
            galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
            who used the stars to travel by.
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders,
            to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in 
            our solar system.

            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question
            of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin 
            proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
            understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today
            have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
            creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
            number of dinosaurs too.

          From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering 
          us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
          For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
          improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of 
          exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major 
          breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
          Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from 
          observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it

            The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
            intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
            applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future 
            is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more 
            important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not
            just for humans but for the whole planet.
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face 
            including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on
            the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
